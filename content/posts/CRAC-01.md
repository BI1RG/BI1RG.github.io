# CRAC-01 Mission Brief

CRAC-01 is a small satellite designed by Engineering Team of Chinese Radio Amateursâ€™ Club, Reger Technology and the Beijing No. 15th middle school students. The target is to have the amateur radio in the space and educational program with middle school students. The space amateur radio station will provide: 

* VHF telemetry downlink.

* UHF telecommand uplink.

* V/U NBFM transponder.

* X band image data downlink experiment. 

The X band image data downlink will be controlled through UHF public telecommand channel.

The educational mission includes:

* Fruit fly cartridge for the biology experiment in the space;

* The photographic captured on the orbit.
